# apmyx

A GUI based Apple Music downloader for Atmos, Lossless, and AAC formats for windows. (needs to be built from source for MacOS, Linux)
**Get the latest Windows app from [releases](https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui/releases/download/v0.2.0/apmyx-win-v0.2.0.zip)**

## About

Easily download your playlists, songs, albums, artist discographies, and music videos.
Some browsers may block the download, flagging the zip file as harmful, which is a false positive. You can also download it from [Telegram](https://t.me/apmyx/2).
The file contains no malicious scripts. The warning appears because it is not signed. You can safely ignore it and select 'Run Anyway' when opening the .exe.

## Requirements

You need an **active Apple Music subscription** to download music.

### Getting Your Media User Token

You need a **media user token** for downloading AAC LC quality and lyrics.

**For Chrome:**

1. Install the [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc?pli=1) extension.
2. Open the Apple Music website and log in to your account.
3. Click the extension icon and then the export button to save the cookies.txt file.
4. Open the file and find the line for "media-user-token".
5. Copy the long value from that line.
6. Paste the value into the apmyx settings field.

**For Firefox:**

1. Install the [Export Cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-cookies-txt/) extension.
2. Open the Apple Music website and log in to your account.
3. Click the extension icon and choose to export cookies for music.apple.com.
4. Open the saved file and find the line for "media-user-token".
5. Copy the long value from that line.
6. Paste the value into the apmyx settings field.

**Note**: Donâ€™t include leading or trailing spaces when pasting the token, paste it exactly (for example at end "==", not "== " ). Extra spaces will cause errors. You can also enter the token manually in config.yaml.

**Note:** Without this token, you can only download higher quality formats like ALAC and Atmos (when using the wrapper). AAC LC and lyrics will not be available.

* AAC Downmix
### Step 1: Download and Install WSL

Download the required files from the link below:

[Download AMDL WSL1 ALL IN ONE.zip](https://github.com/itouakirai/apple-music-jshook-script/releases/download/wsa/AMDL-WSL1.ALL.IN.ONE.zip)

1. Extract the downloaded zip file
2. Run the batch script named **0-1 Install WSL1(need to reboot later).bat**
3. This will install WSL on your computer
4. **Important:** Restart your computer after installation completes to avoid errors

### Step 2: Install Ubuntu and Dependencies

1. After restarting, run the script named **0-2 Install Ubuntu-AMDL(only once).bat**
2. This will install Ubuntu on WSL
3. It will also install all required dependencies for the wrapper

### Step 3: Configure and Start the Wrapper

1. Open script **1. Run decryptor (!!!need to replace username and password in this file).bat** in a text editor like Notepad
2. Find the text that says "username:password" and replace it with your Apple Music credentials. Make sure to close your credentials in " " like in example.
   * Example: "youremail@example.com:yourpassword"
3. Save the file
4. Run script **1. Run decryptor (!!!need to replace username and password in this file).bat** to start the wrapper
5. Wait until you see "response type 6 and listening status" in the wrapper window
6. Ignore all other scripts in the folder

### Step 4: Start the script

Download the app for windows from releases and extract it and open apmyx.exe 

OR

From the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui.git
cd apmyx-gui
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
python main.py
```
# Building from Source

For developers, contributors, or users on macOS and Linux, you can run the application directly from the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or newer. ([Download here](https://golang.org/dl/))
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or newer. ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Required Tools**: FFmpeg, mp4box, and mp4decrypt. Follow the installation steps for your OS in the Required Tools section above.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Get the Code

Clone the project repository to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rwnk-12/apmyx-gui.git
cd apmyx-gui
cd scripts
```

### 2. Build the Backend

This step compiles the Go program that handles all downloading and processing.

```bash
# For macOS & Linux (make the script executable first)
chmod +x build_go.sh
./build_go.sh

# For Windows (using Git Bash or WSL)
./build_go.sh
```

A `downloader` (or `downloader.exe`) file will be created in the `src/core/` directory.

### 3. Set Up the Python Environment

This creates an isolated environment and installs the Python libraries needed for the GUI.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On macOS & Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application

Once the backend is built and the Python environment is set up, you can start the app.

```bash
python main.py
```

The application window should now appear.
